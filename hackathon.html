      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>"This interdisciplinary event brings together students from across degrees, majors, and schools at Cornell
        University! Teams comprised of veterinary, business, engineering, and design students, come together to create
        solutions to needs in veterinary health care. On Saturday, mentors provide feedback and guidance to teams. On
        Sunday, the hackathon culminates in a project showcase to an audience of peers, mentors, and company
        representatives."</p>
